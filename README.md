# Cyclic-STBC-for-MIMO-Systems

The aim of this project is to design cyclic space-time block codes for the MIMO systems by using exhaustive computer searching method, for a fixed L, to optimize the coding gain and compare the normalized coding gain and spectral efficiency for different L values and for integer and non-integer optimal parameter(u) values.
